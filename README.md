This repository stores my notes for Git and Github tutorial
Here I will store the basic commands and the thing to remember regarding git and github.
The content is based on Apna college git and github tutorial , taught by Shraddha Khapra ma'am.
The following are the commands used in github 
1) git clone <---some link---> this command is used to clone a git repository to the system memory(local PC) , where we add the link of the repository
2) git status - displays the status of the code ( whether it is up to date with the main branch or not) ---> when we check git status we can get 4 types of results, 1- Untracked this means new file has been added which git is not able to track.    2- modified- it means the file has been changed.     3- staged- file is ready to be committed.      4- unmodified- unchanged
3) after we modify the code, we need to perform 2 steps to sync our local code with the github repository -- add and commit           git add <--filename--> adds new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area    commit - git commit -m "some message"     it is the record of the change
